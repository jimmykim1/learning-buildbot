# learning-buildbot
Hopefully successfully creating a buildbot environment <br />
Including (but with possibly more stuff) a master.cfg, a build script, a Dockerfile and a docker-compose.yml <br />
Do we need to add more for masters and workers? No, right? <br />
Do we need to install stuff locally, or can that just be defined in the Dockerfile?
