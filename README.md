# learning-buildbot
Hopefully successfully creating a buildbot environment \n
Including (but with possibly more stuff) a master.cfg, a build script, a Dockerfile and a docker-compose.yml \n
Do we need to add more for masters and workers? No, right? \n
Do we need to install stuff locally, or can that just be defined in the Dockerfile?
